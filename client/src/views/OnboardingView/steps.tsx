        Hexagon is a Golem Foundation experiment in decentralised governance and funding projects
        for the public good.
        <br />
        <br />
        To get started, connect your wallet and lock some GLM in the Earn tab. If you donâ€™t have any
        GLM or you want to know more about locking, this{' '}

        has all you need to know to get started.

      <div>
        If you lock more than 100 GLM, you will earn rewards in ETH for every epoch you have tokens
        locked. Tokens can be unlocked at any time.
        <br />
        <br />
        You can choose to withdraw your earnings or allocate them to public good projects, which you
        can browse in the <span className={styles.bold}>Projects</span> tab.

      <div>
        Projects you shortlist for allocation will appear here in the{' '}
        <span className={styles.bold}>Allocate</span> tab. You can allocate some, or all of your ETH
        rewards.
        <br />
        <br />
        Rewards allocated will have Golem Foundation match funding applied, so donating will
        multiply the impact of your earnings compared to withdrawing it.

        The <span className={styles.bold}>Metrics</span> tab shows a range of stats about the
        current and previous epochs to help inform your allocation decisions and generally provide
        an overview of Hexagon.
