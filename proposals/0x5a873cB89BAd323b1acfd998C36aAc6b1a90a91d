  "name": "Ranger 7",
  "description": "Ranger 7 launched on July 28, 1964 and was the seventh in a series of early U.S. lunar impact missions. It proved to be the first successful mission after 13 failures in a row. The mission resulted in over 4 thousand images of the Moon, which later helped identify safe Moon landing sites for Apollo astronauts. Sadly, Ranger 7 met its end crashing into the Moon on the northern rim of the Sea of Clouds.",
